# Real Estate API

The Real Estate API is a Node.js and Express.js-powered API created by Francis Ihejirika. This API serves as a test API designed to power a real estate application. It provides endpoints to manage different property types, including houses and lands.

It was created for a real estate company Unilodge that offers real estate services such as sale of lands, houses and rental of same. 

It also offers administrative functionalities for managing users and properties, while managers can oversee both properties and users effectively. The webapp utilizes WordPress as the Content Management System for its blog, which is deployed on a subdomain, and utilizes WooCommerce for its shop page also deployed on a sub domain.

The backend of this project, in addition to the other functionalities listed above, has a separate route to query the REST API for the WordPress blog, pulling in only the required data.

The backend also employs a mail verification system that generates a 6-digit code for new user sign ups, verification of signed up users but unverified users, resetting of password and notifying a specific admin email when there are new bookings.

It's still under development so be sure to manage, edit and update to fit your preference
